How do we best unpack the relationship between migration and economic inequality?” If any of these questions sound familiar, then you are our audience.</blockquote>
                      <h3 class="section-heading">OUR PREMISE</h3>
                      <p id="text1">As a socially-constructed term, “risk” (and migration risk) has myriad interpretations. Looking for simplicity and feasibility of actions, <b>researchers and practitioners often narrow their scope to an unproductive extent.</b> We have all been there. However, <b>a complex concept requires complex interpretations.</b> A multidimensional issue requires cross-disciplinary action. For good or worse, this is the floor on which we are all standing when studying risk.<br>
   										 <br><br>
                       If, by any chance, you are thinking something along the lines of: <test style="color:blue">“It is easy to talk about such convoluted concepts but much harder to put into practice”.</test>
                         We certainly agree. Nonetheless, we still want to get the ball rolling on flipping the switch, because, in practice, not doing so often leads to fragmented action and to a lack of cooperation between disciplines, institutional sectors, and groups of people. To us, that is significantly more unproductive and detrimental to at-risk populations. Such a grounded issue has been raised by many experts in the area. We just want to put it into practice.<br>
                       <br><br>
                       <b>This is an exercise to prove a bigger point,</b> a diagrammatic attempt to push for us to reconsider how we conceive multidimensional concepts like migration risk. Interpretations that translate to action depend on the eye of the beholder, and we believe that the eye can do much more.<br>

                       <br><br>
                       <test style="color:red">METHODOLOGICAL DISCLAIMER: We are not looking for the perfect statistical model. If your first instinct is to discard these numbers because of methodological nuances, please bear with us and go back to our premise. This is a conceptual exercise to help frame a bigger problem: the need to consider several aspects of interactions of risk in practice.</test></p>

                        <p id="text1">As you will see in the diagram below, <b>this exercise equates migration risk with an individual’s intention to migrate to another country.</b> We used data from a World Food Programme survey on migration in the Northern Triangle (n= 4,998), which includes responses from El Salvador (n= 1,703), Honduras (n= 1,565), and Guatemala (n= 1,730) (WFP, 2021). To work with some of the multiple dimensions of migration risk, we selected variables in eight different categories within those data, including <test style="color:#ec1c24">food security</test>, <test style="color:#eb008b">economic security</test>, <test style="color:#90278e">housing,</test> <test style="color:#0087a4">disasters</test>,
                          <test style="color:#d6de23">individual perceptions</test>, <test style="color:#ffdd00">demographics</test>, <test style="color:#fbb615">geographic location</test>, and <test style="color:#f6921e">infrastructure</test>.<br>
    										<br><br>
                        Our beholder has two eyes. The first is the one that assesses individual relationships to a single outcome (i.e. Is there an association between X and Y?). Once more, the outcome is an individual’s intention to migrate to a different country. For this part, we ran simple linear regressions between all 42 variables (or predictors) and the outcome. The second assesses the relationship between the same variables and outcome, except this time they all contribute to the result instead of being evaluated individually (i.e. Is there an association between X and Y, when controlling for A, B, C...?). Here, we used multiple linear regression.<br>

                        Our diagram shows the strength of the prior associations. A bar with a value between 1 and 3 shows a statistically significant association. The color of each bar indicates the group to which the variable belongs to (demographics, food security, economic security, infrastructure, housing, disasters, individual perceptions, and geographic location).</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">OUR RESULTS</h2>
                        <p>The simple linear regressions show varied results. The strongest associations with an intention to migrate externally include having received governmental aid (economic security), lacking access to gas or electricity for cooking (infrastructure), lacking housing tenure (housing), living in communities where violence increased in the last year, having a decreased income due to the COVID-19 pandemic (hazards), considering that most children in the country do not have the opportunity to learn and grow daily, having confidence in the country’s election, and considering that migration brings good consequences to families (perceptions). In other words, statistically significant associations span across categories.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        The multiple linear regression brings to light some new variables and downplays others. In this model, some of the strongest associations include gender, age (demographics), being unsatisfied with your current living conditions, and the belief that migration brings good consequences to families (perceptions). In simpler terms, being young, male, unhappy, and believing that migration is good all have strong associations with intending to migrate externally. Other new associations include coming from a larger household (demographics), having the need to reduce food portions in the past 7 days to feed other household members (food security), having insufficient income to cover food and expenses in the last 30 days (economic security), and/or living in a female owned household (perceptions). In this last model, the R2 value equals 0.70, which means that the model predicts 70% of the variability in the outcome.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        We understand that association in these models does not mean causation, but we still believe they reinforce our larger premises: <b>that risk components are in the eye of the beholder, and that such beholders ought to widen his, her, or their views to develop more impactful actions.</b> As we can see in the diagrams, statistically significant associations span across categories and disciplines, and they switch depending on how and what researchers and practitioners want to consider. We believe that the more we consider, the closer we will get to producing policies, programs, and other types of responses that are better suited to help communities in need.</p>
