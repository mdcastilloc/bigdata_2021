                      <h2 class="section-heading">BACKGROUND</h2>
                      <p id="text1">The trends in the data indicate a strong correlation between intention to migrate and a person being young, male, dissatisfied with their living area, and who consider that migration abroad will bring good consequences to families.<br>
   										 <br><br>
   										 The data showed moderate (but still statistically significant) correlations with respondents who report insufficient household income to purchase food, subject to one or more types of insecurity, and with households that have experienced a total loss of income due to the pandemic.<br>
   										 <br><br>
   										 The main drivers for these trends, as surveyed by the Congressional Research Service, include difficult socioeconomic and security conditions - which are exacerbated by natural disasters and poor governance.</p>

                       <!-- second section -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">RELATED FACTORS</h2>
                        <p id="text1">The working-age populations of Northern Triangle countries are young, with 45% of Guatemalans, 42% of Hondurans and 36% of Salvadorans under the age of 20.<br>
    										<br><br>
    										Central America has become drier and hotter in recent decades, with prolonged droughts since 2014. Crop loss and declining employment in the coffee sector have made especially rural families vulnerable to unemployment and hunger.<br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Young male migrants tend to...</blockquote>
                        <br><br>
    										Surveys of Northern Triangle migrants found that nearly all were moving to find work (which explains the young, male trend).<br>
    										<br><br>
    										Also poverty and gang violence, but those studies are cited more to explain the motivation of unaccompanied children who were apprehended at the border.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
